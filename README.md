# ActiveMQ configured as External Broker for SailPoint IIQ 8.4

This repository contains a ready-to-use `activemq.xml` file configured for Apache ActiveMQ as an **external messaging broker** integrated with **SailPoint IdentityIQ 8.4**, especially for the **Data Extract** module and statistics queues.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only the `activemq.xml` file is published to keep the repository clean. Other required configuration files are documented below.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites and Installation

To use this configuration, you'll need the following:

### ‚úÖ System Requirements

- **Operating System**: RHEL 8 or 9 (tested on RHEL 9.0)
- **Java**: OpenJDK 11 (ActiveMQ 5.17.x requires Java 8 or 11)
- **Memory**: Minimum 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)
- **Ports**: Open TCP ports 61616 (broker), 8161 (web console)
- **Network Access**: Ensure IIQ server can reach this ActiveMQ host

### üì¶ Required Software

- Apache ActiveMQ 5.17.x:
  - [Download here](https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/download/)
  - Choose the binary distribution (`apache-activemq-5.17.x-bin.tar.gz`)

### üìÅ Installation Directory Structure

Assume you're installing under `/opt/activemq`:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/activemq
cd /opt
sudo tar -xzf apache-activemq-5.17.x-bin.tar.gz
sudo mv apache-activemq-5.17.x activemq
```

Ensure permissions are correct:

```bash
sudo chown -R activemq:activemq /opt/activemq
```

### üöÄ Starting the Broker

To start ActiveMQ:

```bash
/opt/activemq/bin/activemq start
```

Optional: create a systemd service for persistence.

### üî• Open Required Ports

Make sure the following firewall ports are open:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=61616/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8161/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Once the service is running, ActiveMQ will automatically create the required queues when they are first used by SailPoint IdentityIQ (as long as the authenticated user has admin rights on queues).


### `conf/activemq.xml`

This file defines:

- The queues required for SailPoint IIQ data extraction and statistics.
- Roles and access control for users.
- Authentication via JAAS (`jaasAuthenticationPlugin`).
- Permissions for internal ActiveMQ topics (`Advisory`, `Statistics`).

---

## üîê Authentication Configuration Using Flat Files

After downloading and extracting ActiveMQ from the official website, configure the following files if using file-based authentication (`login.config` + JAAS):

### `users.properties`

Defines the users and passwords that SailPoint IIQ will use to connect to the broker:

```properties
# Users for connections from SailPoint IIQ
amq_adminuser=adminpassword123
amq_produceruser=producerpassword123
amq_consumeruser=consumerpassword123
```

üìç Expected path: `/opt/activemq/conf/users.properties`

---

### `groups.properties`

Defines the roles assigned to each user. These must match the roles defined in `activemq.xml` (admins, producers, consumers).

```properties
# Role assignments for the users
admins=amq_adminuser
producers=amq_produceruser
consumers=amq_consumeruser
```

üìç Expected path: `/opt/activemq/conf/groups.properties`

---

## üîÑ Required Restart

Whenever you modify these configuration files, restart ActiveMQ:

```bash
/opt/activemq/bin/activemq stop
/opt/activemq/bin/activemq start
```

---

## üß© Integration with Active Directory (for production environments)

You can replace flat file authentication with integration via **Active Directory (AD)** using JAAS. To do this:

### 1. Edit the `login.config` file:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/activemq/conf/login.config
```

Example LDAP/AD configuration:

```properties
activemq-domain {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
    userProvider="ldap://dc.example.com:389/ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com"
    authIdentity="{USERNAME}"
    userFilter="(sAMAccountName={USERNAME})"
    useSSL=false
    debug=true;
};
```

> You may also use Apache Shiro or Spring LDAP modules for more advanced control.

---

### 2. Map AD groups to ActiveMQ roles in `activemq.xml`

Ensure your AD groups are named exactly as the roles in the authorization section:

```xml
<authorizationEntry queue=">" read="consumers" write="producers" admin="admins"/>
```

Make sure your AD users belong to the matching groups (`consumers`, `producers`, `admins`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è SailPoint IIQ Configuration

In IdentityIQ, go to:

`Global Settings ‚Üí Messaging Configuration`

Fill out the form as follows:

### Typical Values:

| Field                            | Example Value                                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

| Client Connection String         | `failover:(tcp://activemq-host:61616)?initialReconnectDelay=100&maxReconnectAttempts=5` |
| Consumer Username                | `amq_consumeruser`                                 |
| Consumer Password                | `consumerpassword123`                              |

| Admin Password                   | `adminpassword123`                                 |
| Broker Statistics Queue Name     | `queue://iiqBrokerStatsQueue`                      |
| Destinations Statistics Queue    | `queue://iiqDestinationStatsQueue`                 |
| Subscriptions Statistics Queue   | `queue://iiqSubscriptionStatsQueue`                |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Recommendations

- In production, use secure authentication (e.g., AD, Vault).
- Restrict broker access to authorized servers only.
- Consider switching to SSL (`ssl://`) instead of plain TCP.
- Monitor broker health using the web console or JMX.

## üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Create a systemd Service (Recommended for Production)

To enable automatic startup and proper service management, create a `systemd` service for ActiveMQ.

### üìÑ Create the service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/activemq.service
```

Paste the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Apache ActiveMQ Broker
After=network.target

[Service]
User=activemq
Group=activemq
ExecStart=/opt/activemq/bin/activemq start
ExecStop=/opt/activemq/bin/activemq stop
Restart=on-failure
SuccessExitStatus=143

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### ‚úÖ Enable and Start the Service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable activemq
sudo systemctl start activemq
sudo systemctl status activemq
```

This ensures ActiveMQ starts at boot and can be managed via `systemctl`.
